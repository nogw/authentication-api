# authentication-api

simple authentication api for study, and also, to reuse the code in future projects, and improve the decor that I evolve  

## routes  

- /register  
as the name already says, to create the user in the bank, and returns a jwt with the name and id of the user created  

- /login  
as the name also says, to login the user, and returns a jwt with the user's information
